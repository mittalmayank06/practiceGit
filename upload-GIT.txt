I'm practicing GIT & upload files on GITHUB.

STEP1: To get repo, 2-ways:
	-initialize the repo (start from begining)
	-cloning the git (get data from the server)
->ls -lart (show us hidden files in a folder)

->git status (show us the status of git)
->git add index.html (files, which needs to add in staging area)
	-or ->git add -A  (to put all files in staging area)
->git status  (files put in staging area, needs to be commit)
->git commit -m "Initial Commit"   (commit to save the file structure..)
	-"wq ->[Enter] (to exit)

[NOTE: If by mistake, 1 file got updated & u need to get back prev. commit  ]
->git checkout [file_name]
OR ->git checkout -f  (to get all files to last commit)


->git log  (gives details who commit in the file)
OR   ->git log -p -5  (tells us last 5 commit details)

->git diff  (compares our modifiled file from working area to staging area)
->git diff --stage (compares staging area with last commit)

->git rm --cached  waste.html  (remove file from staging area only)
->git rm waste.html (removes the file completely)


->git status -s (show us files which're in staging area or working tree)
*******************************************
GIT-branch concept:
 ->git branch feature1  (feature1 branch created & we can create copy of our code on this branch from master)

->git branch
(show us branches available)

->git checkout feature1 (switched to feature1 branch)

->git checkout -b feature2 (created & switched to branch feature2)
->GO to MASTER branch:
& merge with feature1 branch as:

->git merge feature1  (merge repo: master with feature1)
****************************************
Remote repository: 
->git remote add origin  [SSH_link of repo on github]
//it will add code of our local repo(system) to the remote(server) repo.

->git remote
output: origin  (gives us link of server where u put our code)
-> git push origin master (pushes code of our master to origin)
OR  -> git push -u origin master


->git remote set-url origin [ssh_link or http-link]
\\this command will change the link for origin
